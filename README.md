# Finite Automata Programming

This project was developed as part of the practical session (TME) for the course **LU2IN005 — Discrete Mathematics** at Sorbonne University (Academic Year 2022-2023).

The goal of the project is to implement various algorithms and operations on finite automata in Python, based on the provided data structures.

## Description

The project is organized as a Jupyter Notebook:

- **Automate.ipynb**: Contains all the implemented algorithms.
- Uses the provided classes `State`, `Transition`, and `AutomateBase`.
- Several classical algorithms on finite automata are implemented (construction, determinization, minimization, set operations, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Standard Python modules (`os`, `copy`)
